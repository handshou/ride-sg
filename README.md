## 📝 Development Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm start        # Start production server
pnpm lint         # Run Biome linter (check only)
pnpm format       # Format code with Biome
pnpm fix          # Auto-fix linting issues with Biome
pnpm type-check   # Run TypeScript type checking

```

**Pre-push Hook**: Husky automatically runs `check-all` before every push. Skip with `git push --no-verify` if needed.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Effect-TS Managed Runtime Pattern

The project uses Effect-TS with a **ManagedRuntime** architecture for optimal performance:

- **Single Runtime Instances**: One server runtime, one client runtime (not per-request)
- **Layered Architecture**: BaseLayer (shared) + ServerLayer (server-only) + ClientLayer (client-only)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Initialized via Next.js instrumentation hooks
- **Resource Efficiency**: Service reuse, connection pooling, reduced GC pressure
- **Error Handling**: Type-safe error handling with `Effect.catchAll`
- **Configuration**: Environment variables managed through Effect Config

### Runtime Layers

```typescript
BaseLayer (Shared)
├─ ConfigService: Environment variables
└─ ToastService: Logging & notifications

ServerLayer (Server-only) = BaseLayer +
├─ MapboxService: Geocoding API
├─ RainfallService: NEA rainfall data
├─ BicycleParkingService: LTA bike parking
└─ ExaSearchService: Semantic search

ClientLayer (Client-only) = BaseLayer +
├─ GeolocationService: Browser GPS
├─ MapReadinessService: Map state
├─ MapNavigationService: Map flyTo animations
├─ CrossBorderNavigationService: City detection & navigation
└─ ThemeSyncService: Theme management
```

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 9% faster responses (no layer construction overhead)
- 💾 Lower memory usage (services instantiated once)
- 🔄 HTTP connection pooling (reused across requests)
- 📊 Better fiber management (shared pool)

See [docs/RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

### Key Services

**15 Effect-TS Services:** ExaSearchService, DatabaseSearchService, ConvexService, MapboxService, BicycleParkingService, RainfallService, SearchStateService, GeolocationService, RandomCoordinatesService, ToastService, ThemeSyncService, MapReadinessService, ConfigService, MapNavigationService, CrossBorderNavigationService

**Convex Schema:** 3 tables (locations, bicycleParking, rainfall) with caching and indexing

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for testing Effect-TS services (63 tests in ~1s)
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for browser testing across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (21 tests in ~40s)
- **Quality Checks**: Pre-push hook runs full test suite automatically

## 🎨 Visual Regression Testing

Percy integration for visual regression testing catches UI changes automatically:

```bash
# Run visual tests (requires PERCY_TOKEN)
pnpm test:visual

# Run visual tests with browser visible (local development)
pnpm test:visual:local
```

### Setup

1. Sign up at [percy.io](https://percy.io) (free for open source)
2. Create a project and get your `PERCY_TOKEN`
3. Add to your environment:
   ```bash
   export PERCY_TOKEN=your_token_here
   # or add to .env file
   ```
4. Run tests - Percy will capture baselines on first run

### What's Tested

- **Map Loading**: Initial map render and controls
- **Search Panel**: Search interface and results display  
- **Convex Integration**: Database result badges and UI state

### Usage

- **Cost**: ~4 snapshots/run × ~40 runs/month = ~160 snapshots/month (3% of 5000 limit)
- **Browser**: Chromium only (1280px desktop viewport)
- **When to run**: Before releases or when UI changes are made
- **Baselines**: Approve changes via Percy dashboard to update baselines

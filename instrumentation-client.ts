 * Client Runtime Instrumentation
 *
 * This file runs BEFORE the Next.js app becomes interactive on the client.
 * It creates a managed Effect runtime with all client-side services.
 *
 * The runtime is created using ManagedRuntime.make(), which:
 * - Initializes all services in ClientLayer
 * - Provides proper lifecycle management
 * - Enables efficient service reuse across components
 *
 * Unlike server instrumentation, client instrumentation runs immediately
 * at module initialization (not in an async function).
 *
 * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation-client
